## Might need to change this path, but we use the 2025 season csv to create our schedule of games that will be played.
season2025 <- read.csv("season2025.csv")

## Only keep regular season games(drop preseason games). We do this by checking to see whether the Week column is numeric(regular season) or not(preseason).
season2025 <- subset(season2025, grepl("^[0-9]+$", Week))

## Then create the upcoming schedule
upcoming_schedule <- data.frame(HomeTm = season2025$HomeTm, VisTm = season2025$VisTm)




## Method 1, Monte Carlo

## Args: skillTable - a skill table that gives the ability for each team, nsim - the number of simulations to run

## The result of this function is a 32x18 matrix, where the [i, j] entry is the empirical probability of the ith team getting j wins(a team get 0-17 wins).
monteCarlo <- function(skillTable, nsim = 10000)

  teams <- skillTable$Team
  
  win_counts <- matrix(0, nrow = 32, ncol = 18)
  rownames(win_counts) <- teams

    # Used to keep track of number of wins for each team in this simulated 2025 season

      awaySkill <- skillTable$Skill[skillTable$Team == awayTeam]
      
      # Not sure if this is the right win probability from BT
      probHomeWin <- exp(homeSkill) / (exp(homeSkill) + exp(awaySkill))
      
      ## Simulate the result of the match as a Bernoulli trial
      simulatedResult <- rbinom(1, 1, prob = probHomeWin)
      
      if (simulatedResult == 1)
      {
        season_wins[homeTeam] = season_wins[homeTeam] + 1

      else
      {
        season_wins[awayTeam] = season_wins[awayTeam] + 1
      }
    }
    
    ## Now we update the win counter(0-17) for each team
    for (t in teams)
    {
      # We do +1 for season_wins[t] because of zero subscript
      wins <- season_wins[t]

      win_counts[t, wins + 1] <- win_counts[t, wins + 1] + 1
    }

  simulated_win_probs <- win_counts / nsim
  
  # Then return
  return(simulated_win_probs)

}

## I tested the functionality using this 2025 skill table
## sampleSkillTable <- read.csv("2025_skill.csv")



## Method 2, Poisson Binomial dist
## Not implemented yet
